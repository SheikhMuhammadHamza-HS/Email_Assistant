# Email_Assistant
this repo Represent The email agent, powered by Gemini and Chainlit, automatically reads emails and decides if theyâ€™re important (like meetings), spam (like fake offers), or unimportant (like random chats). It summarizes important emails, saves them to summaries.txt, and writes polite replies if needed, all shown instantly in a chat window.
